 * Project: PEX2 - CPU Scheduling Simulator
 * Purpose: Declares the SharedVars and CpuParams structures that are
 *          shared between the main clock thread and all CPU scheduling
 *          threads, and provides prototypes for the six scheduling
 *          thread functions that students implement in CPUs.c.
